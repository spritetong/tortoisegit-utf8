<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<simpara>Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their
histories diverged from the current branch) into the current
branch.  This command is used by <emphasis>git pull</emphasis> to incorporate changes
from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes
from one branch into another.</simpara>
<simpara>Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
"<emphasis>master</emphasis>":</simpara>
<screen>          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master</screen>
<simpara>Then "<emphasis>git merge topic</emphasis>" will replay the changes made on the
<emphasis>topic</emphasis> branch since it diverged from <emphasis>master</emphasis> (i.e., <emphasis>E</emphasis>) until
its current commit (<emphasis>C</emphasis>) on top of <emphasis>master</emphasis>, and record the result
in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and
a log message from the user describing the changes.</simpara>
<screen>          A---B---C topic
         /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master</screen>
<simpara>The second syntax (&lt;msg&gt; <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> &lt;commit&gt;&#8230;) is supported for
historical reasons.  Do not use it from the command line or in
new scripts.  It is the same as <emphasis>git merge -m &lt;msg&gt; &lt;commit&gt;...</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>The third syntax ("<emphasis>git merge --abort</emphasis>") can only be run after the
merge has resulted in conflicts. <emphasis>git merge --abort</emphasis> will abort the
merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However,
if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and
especially if those changes were further modified after the merge
was started), <emphasis>git merge --abort</emphasis> will in some cases be unable to
reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Warning</emphasis>: Running <emphasis>git merge</emphasis> with uncommitted changes is
discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a state that is hard to
back out of in the case of a conflict.</simpara>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--commit

--no-commit
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
        be used to override --no-commit.
</simpara>
<simpara>With --no-commit perform the merge but pretend the merge
failed and do not autocommit, to give the user a chance to
inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing.</simpara>

<varlistentry>
<term>
--edit

</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to
        further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user
        can explain and justify the merge. The <emphasis>--no-edit</emphasis> option can be
        used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally
        discouraged). The <emphasis>--edit</emphasis> option is still useful if you are
        giving a draft message with the <emphasis>-m</emphasis> option from the command line
        and want to edit it in the editor.
</simpara>
<simpara>Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the
user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor opened when
they run <emphasis>git merge</emphasis>. To make it easier to adjust such scripts to the
updated behaviour, the environment variable <emphasis>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT</emphasis> can be
set to <emphasis>no</emphasis> at the beginning of them.</simpara>

<simplesect id="_pre_merge_checks">
<title>PRE-MERGE CHECKS</title>
<simpara>Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in
good shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if
there are conflicts.  See also <xref linkend="git-stash(1)" />.
<emphasis>git pull</emphasis> and <emphasis>git merge</emphasis> will stop without doing anything when
local uncommitted changes overlap with files that <emphasis>git pull</emphasis>/<emphasis>git
merge</emphasis> may need to update.</simpara>
<simpara>To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit,
<emphasis>git pull</emphasis> and <emphasis>git merge</emphasis> will also abort if there are any changes
registered in the index relative to the <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> commit.  (One
exception is when the changed index entries are in the state that
would result from the merge already.)</simpara>
<simpara>If all named commits are already ancestors of <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis>, <emphasis>git merge</emphasis>
will exit early with the message "Already up-to-date."</simpara>
</simplesect>
<simplesect id="_fast_forward_merge">
<title>FAST-FORWARD MERGE</title>
<simpara>Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit.
This is the most common case especially when invoked from <emphasis>git
pull</emphasis>: you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed
no local changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream
revision.  In this case, a new commit is not needed to store the
combined history; instead, the <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> (along with the index) is
updated to point at the named commit, without creating an extra
merge commit.</simpara>
<simpara>This behavior can be suppressed with the <emphasis>--no-ff</emphasis> option.</simpara>
</simplesect>
<simplesect id="_true_merge">
<title>TRUE MERGE</title>
<simpara>Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be
merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them
as its parents.</simpara>
<simpara>A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
merged is committed, and your <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis>, index, and working tree are
updated to it.  It is possible to have modifications in the working
tree as long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.</simpara>
<simpara>When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
happens:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> pointer stays the same.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis>MERGE_HEAD</emphasis> ref is set to point to the other branch head.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and
   in your working tree.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three
   versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor,
   stage 2 from <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis>, and stage 3 from <emphasis>MERGE_HEAD</emphasis> (you
   can inspect the stages with <emphasis>git ls-files -u</emphasis>).  The working
   tree files contain the result of the "merge" program; i.e. 3-way
   merge results with familiar conflict markers <emphasis>&lt;&lt;&lt;</emphasis> <emphasis>===</emphasis> <emphasis>&gt;&gt;&gt;</emphasis>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
No other changes are made.  In particular, the local
   modifications you had before you started merge will stay the
   same and the index entries for them stay as they were,
   i.e. matching <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and
want to start over, you can recover with <emphasis>git merge --abort</emphasis>.</simpara>
</simplesect>
<simplesect id="_how_conflicts_are_presented">
<title>HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED</title>
<simpara>During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the result
of the merge.  Among the changes made to the common ancestor's version,
non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file while the
other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the
final result verbatim.  When both sides made changes to the same area,
however, git cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to
resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, git uses the same style as that is used by "merge" program
from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like this:</simpara>
<screen>Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.</screen>
<simpara>The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with markers
<emphasis>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</emphasis>, <emphasis>=======</emphasis>, and <emphasis>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</emphasis>.  The part before the <emphasis>=======</emphasis>
is typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.</simpara>
<simpara>The default format does not show what the original said in the conflicting
area.  You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced with
Barbie's remark on your side.  The only thing you can tell is that your
side wants to say it is hard and you'd prefer to go shopping, while the
other side wants to claim it is easy.</simpara>
<simpara>An alternative style can be used by setting the "merge.conflictstyle"
configuration variable to "diff3".  In "diff3" style, the above conflict
may look like this:</simpara>
<screen>Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.

<simpara>In addition to the <emphasis>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</emphasis>, <emphasis>=======</emphasis>, and <emphasis>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</emphasis> markers, it uses
another <emphasis>|||||||</emphasis> marker that is followed by the original text.  You can
tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave in to
that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have a more
positive attitude.  You can sometimes come up with a better resolution by
viewing the original.</simpara>

<title>HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS</title>
<simpara>After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Decide not to merge.  The only clean-ups you need are to reset
   the index file to the <emphasis>HEAD</emphasis> commit to reverse 2. and to clean
   up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; <emphasis>git merge --abort</emphasis>
   can be used for this.

</listitem>

<simpara>
Resolve the conflicts.  Git will mark the conflicts in

   <emphasis>git add</emphasis> them to the index.  Use <emphasis>git commit</emphasis> to seal the deal.
</simpara>
</listitem>

</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Look at the diffs from each branch. <emphasis>git log --merge -p &lt;path&gt;</emphasis>

<listitem>
<simpara>
        This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
        and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge
        algorithm.  It tries to carefully detect criss-cross

        fast.

recursive
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
        algorithm.  When there is more than one common
        ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a
        merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
        the reference tree for the 3-way merge.  This has been
        reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without
        causing mis-merges by tests done on actual merge commits
        taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
        Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving
        renames.  This is the default merge strategy when
        pulling or merging one branch.

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
ours

        This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by
        favoring <emphasis>our</emphasis> version.  Changes from the other tree that do not
        conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result.
</simpara>
<simpara>This should not be confused with the <emphasis>ours</emphasis> merge strategy, which does not
even look at what the other tree contains at all.  It discards everything
the other tree did, declaring <emphasis>our</emphasis> history contains all that happened in it.</simpara>

        This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages

        filters or end-of-line normalization rules.  See "Merging

        two trees to match.

<listitem>
<simpara>
        This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do
        a complex merge that needs manual resolution.  It is
        primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch
        heads together.  This is the default merge strategy when
        pulling or merging more than one branch.

ours

<listitem>
<simpara>
        This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the
        merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively
        ignoring all changes from all other branches.  It is meant to
        be used to supersede old development history of side
        branches.  Note that this is different from the -Xours option to
        the <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> merge strategy.

subtree

        This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and
        B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to
        match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at
        the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common
        ancestor tree.

merge.ff

<listitem>

        By default, git does not create an extra merge commit when merging
        a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
        tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <emphasis>false</emphasis>,
        this variable tells git to create an extra merge commit in such
        a case (equivalent to giving the <emphasis>--no-ff</emphasis> option from the command
        line). When set to <emphasis>only</emphasis>, only such fast-forward merges are
        allowed (equivalent to giving the <emphasis>--ff-only</emphasis> option from the

        Tell git that canonical representation of files in the
        repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record
        text files with CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line
        endings).  In such a repository, git can convert the data
        recorded in commits to a canonical form before performing a
        merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts.  For more information,
