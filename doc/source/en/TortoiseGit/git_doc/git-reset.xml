<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<simpara>In the first and second form, copy entries from &lt;commit&gt; to the index.
In the third form, set the current branch head (HEAD) to &lt;commit&gt;, optionally
modifying index and working tree to match.  The &lt;commit&gt; defaults to HEAD
in all forms.</simpara>

<varlistentry>
<term>
<emphasis>git reset</emphasis> [-q] [&lt;commit&gt;] [--] &lt;paths&gt;&#8230;
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        This form resets the index entries for all &lt;paths&gt; to their
        state at &lt;commit&gt;.  (It does not affect the working tree, nor
        the current branch.)
</simpara>
<simpara>This means that <emphasis>git reset &lt;paths&gt;</emphasis> is the opposite of <emphasis>git add
&lt;paths&gt;</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>After running <emphasis>git reset &lt;paths&gt;</emphasis> to update the index entry, you can
use <xref linkend="git-checkout(1)" /> to check the contents out of the index to
the working tree.
Alternatively, using <xref linkend="git-checkout(1)" /> and specifying a commit, you
can copy the contents of a path out of a commit to the index and to the
working tree in one go.</simpara>

<emphasis>git reset</emphasis> (--patch | -p) [&lt;commit&gt;] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;&#8230;]
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Interactively select hunks in the difference between the index
        and &lt;commit&gt; (defaults to HEAD).  The chosen hunks are applied
        in reverse to the index.
</simpara>
<simpara>This means that <emphasis>git reset -p</emphasis> is the opposite of <emphasis>git add -p</emphasis>, i.e.
you can use it to selectively reset hunks. See the Interactive Mode
section of <xref linkend="git-add(1)" /> to learn how to operate the <emphasis>--patch</emphasis> mode.</simpara>

        This form resets the current branch head to &lt;commit&gt; and
        possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree of &lt;commit&gt;) and
        the working tree depending on &lt;mode&gt;, which
        must be one of the following:

<simpara>
        Does not touch the index file nor the working tree at all (but
        resets the head to &lt;commit&gt;, just like all modes do). This leaves
        all your changed files "Changes to be committed", as <emphasis>git status</emphasis>
        would put it.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--mixed
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files
        are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not
        been updated. This is the default action.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--hard
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the
        working tree since &lt;commit&gt; are discarded.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--merge
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are
        different between &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD, but keeps those which are
        different between the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes
        which have not been added).
        If a file that is different between &lt;commit&gt; and the index has unstaged
        changes, reset is aborted.
</simpara>
<simpara>In other words, --merge does something like a <emphasis>git read-tree -u -m &lt;commit&gt;</emphasis>,
but carries forward unmerged index entries.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
--keep
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
        Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are
        different between &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD.
        If a file that is different between &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD has local changes,
        reset is aborted.

<simpara>"reset --merge" is meant to be used when resetting out of a conflicted
merge. Any mergy operation guarantees that the working tree file that is
involved in the merge does not have local change wrt the index before
it starts, and that it writes the result out to the working tree. So if
we see some difference between the index and the target and also
between the index and the working tree, then it means that we are not
resetting out from a state that a mergy operation left after failing
with a conflict. That is why we disallow --merge option in this case.</simpara>
<simpara>"reset --keep" is meant to be used when removing some of the last
commits in the current branch while keeping changes in the working
tree. If there could be conflicts between the changes in the commit we
want to remove and the changes in the working tree we want to keep,
the reset is disallowed. That's why it is disallowed if there are both
changes between the working tree and HEAD, and between HEAD and the
target. To be safe, it is also disallowed when there are unmerged
entries.</simpara>
<simpara>The following tables show what happens when there are unmerged
entries:</simpara>
