	Commit each diff from a specified head directly to the SVN repository,
	and then rebase or reset (depending on whether or not there is a diff between SVN and head).
	This will create a revision in SVN for each commit in git. It is recommended that you run
	git-svn fetch and rebase (not pull or merge) your commits against the latest changes in
	the SVN repository. An optional command-line argument may be specified as an alternative
	to HEAD. This is advantageous over set-tree (below) because it produces cleaner,
	more linear history

    <guilabel>Git Style Commit(--rmdir)</guilabel>:Remove directories from the SVN tree 
	if there are no files left behind. SVN can version empty directories, and they are
	not removed by default if there are no files left in them. git cannot version empty
	directories. Enabling this flag will make the commit to SVN act like git.
