	<para>
		For open source projects (like this one) everyone has read
		access to the (main/public) repository, and anyone can make a contribution
		to the project. So how are those contributions controlled?
		If just anyone could commit changes this this central repository, the project would be permanently
		unstable and probably permanently broken. In this situation the
		change is managed by submitting a <firstterm>patch</firstterm> file or a <firstterm>pull request</firstterm>
		to the development team, who do have write access.
		They can review the changes first, and then either submit it to the
		main repository or reject it back to the author.
	</para>
	<para>
		Patch files are simply Unified-Diff files showing the differences
		between your working tree and the base revision.
	</para>
	<para>
		A pull request is an request to another repository owner to <link linkend="tsvn-dug-pull">pull</link>
		changes from your repository. I.e. you must have access to a public repository where you can
		<link linkend="tsvn-dug-push">push</link> your changes (normally a special branch).

				Here Git is different to TortoiseSVN: In TortoiseSVN you directly create a patch instead of committing
				your changes and create a patch of the commits afterwards (in git you have a full local copy/fork of the project you cloned - commits are just local).
				To generate a patch containing the uncommitted,
				but staged, changes click on <guibutton>Save unified diff since HEAD</guibutton>.
				If you need an introduction to version control with Git,
			then we recommend two videos on YouTube:

		<title>Applying a single Patch File</title>
		<para>
			Patch files are applied to your working tree. This should be done
			from the same folder level as was used to create the patch.
			If you are not sure what this is, just look at the first line of
			the patch file. For example, if the first file being worked on was
			<filename>doc/source/english/chapter1.xml</filename>
			and the first line in the patch file is
			<filename>Index: english/chapter1.xml</filename>
			then you need to apply the patch to the
			<filename>doc/source/</filename> folder.
			However, provided you are in the correct working tree, if you
			pick the wrong folder level, TortoiseGit will notice and suggest the
			correct level.
